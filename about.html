        <p>
          Hey! I’m Shubham Gaur — a <em>tech enthusiast</em>, curious problem-solver, and a self-confessed automation nerd who loves building things that actually work.
        </p>

        <p>
          By day, I’m a Senior Test Automation Engineer, helping teams ship quality software faster and smarter. By night (and sometimes during coffee breaks), I’m diving into the latest in AI and automation technology — because why not make testing cooler?
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the last 4+ years, I’ve worked across multiple domains, building solid, scalable automation frameworks using <code>C#</code>, <code>Python</code>, <code>Selenium</code>, <code>Appium</code>, and <code>Playwright</code>. I’ve explored CI/CD pipelines and even brought some AI magic into the QA process.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond the buzzwords, I love learning, experimenting, and improving how we build and test software. I’ve led projects, mentored teammates, and I’m always looking for that next interesting problem to solve.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I’m not deep in code or tinkering with tools, you’ll find me sketching out new project ideas, or geeking out over the newest trends in tech.
